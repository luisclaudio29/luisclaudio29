### I had my first technical encounter with technology and programming when I discovered the C# language, and I was fascinated.

Having the ability to create any type of application, to later be used and appreciated by others, left me astonished and with an exponential desire to evolve and reach the next level.

Being a programmer is much more than just writing code.
Being a programmer is positively impacting people's lives, and somehow making their day-to-day easier and more practical.

I have experience in developing applications in C# with clean code and good architecture, using the following technologies:

ASP.NET
MVC (framework)
.NET Core
Web Forms
Entity Framework
.NET
Using in conjunction with C#:

Angular
SQL
Oracle
Git
Scrum
Kanban
Allied with some personal qualities:

Quick learner
Good communication skills
Experience in giving and receiving feedback
Good organization and management
Problem-solving
Teamwork
